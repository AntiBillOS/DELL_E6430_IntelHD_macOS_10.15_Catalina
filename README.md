This is not my own original work. A lot of stuff taken by me from community so thank them/

So there you got EFI Clover folder dump wich allows you to run macOS 10.15 on E6430

My laptop specs:
>CPU: Intell 3210m Core i5
>GPU: Intell HD 4000
>Display: 14 inch 1366x768
>RAM: 8gb (4+4) SODIMM DDR3 1600mhz
>HDD: 750gb

#BIOS Setup
I use last bios update from DELL and set SATA Operations to `AHCI`, set Boot List Option to `UEFI` and Disable Secure Boot.

If you have any questions or idea to improve config feel free to contact me.
